# Introduction to PolyaViz

PolyaViz is a visualization package for metaheuristic algorithms. It provides a quick and intuitive way to visualize large categories of metaheuristic algorithms in problem-independent manner. On this page, the base concepts of the module are detailed

## Metaheuristics
Metaheuristic algorithms are general-purpose search algorithms to optimize (combinatorial) optimization problems. A metaheuristic is typically composed of several (usually simple) heuristic algorithms and some higher-level procedures to guide/steer the heuristics during the search process.

## Templates
Metaheuristic templates are algorithmic structures that generalize several metaheuristics into a single formalization. This allows for a common ground to compare the efficiency of different algorithms using the same template, or to categorize metaheuristics based on the template they are derived from. As problem-independent formal structures, they are a useful basis for the construction of visualizations of search processes.


## Aim of PolyaViz

The aim of PolyaViz is to provide easy access to template-specific visualizations for metaheuristic algorithms. Researchers, users and developers alike could benefit from insightful visual representations of the algorithms they study, deploy or implement. PolyaViz offers quick access to such visuzalizations through predefined template visualizations, as well as in-depth control over the components, allowing users to construct their own templates or visualizations.
