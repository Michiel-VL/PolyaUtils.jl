# PolyaUtils

**Note: this package is a WIP and still in a very early state. Things might/will break.** 

`PolyaUtils` provides peripheral tooling for metaheuristic research & design. The aim of this package is to offer researchers easy-to-use functionality and reduce the amount of repetitive work. The package leans on other packages to do the heavy lifting, primarily [Luxor.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Luxor.jl), [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) and [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl). For more advanced work, it is advised to directly use the appropriate packages.
